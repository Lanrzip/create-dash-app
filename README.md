# Create Dash App

This repository contains a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template to create Dash apps with front-end and back-end separation based on dash+fastapi+redis+sql!

## Usage

To use this boilerplate:

1. Install cookiecutter:
    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Run cookiecutter on the boilerplate repo:
    ```bash
    cookiecutter gh:Lanrzip/create-dash-app
    ```

3. Answer the questions to create your new Dash app.
    - `project_name`: The name of the project. For example, "My Dash App".
    - `project_shortname`: The short name of the project. For example, for "My Dash App" this would be "my_dash_app".
    - `app_name`: The name of the Dash app in one word.
    - `description`: A short description of the project.
    - `open_source_license`: The license for the project.


4. Enter the project directory and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd my_dash_app  # or whatever you named your project
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```

5. Start the app:
    ```bash
    python frontend/app.py
    python server/app.py  # in a separate terminal
    ```
